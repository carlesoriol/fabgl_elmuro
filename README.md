## About the game

When I was a child and I got my first ZX spectrum there was a demo tape with it. HORIZONS (spanish version). In the tape there was a game EL MURO (the wall). It was a terrible version of breakout, not funny at all to play. But nice to walk arounf the code.

I did this version in a copule of hours to test Fabrizio Di Vittorio VGADirectController. It has been funny.
