# FabGL El Muro
8 bits or less classic breakout for FabGL

When I was a child and I got my first ZX spectrum there was a demo tape with it. HORIZONS (spanish version). In the tape there was a game EL MURO (the wall). It was a terrible version of breakout, not funny at all to play, but was nice to walk around the code.

I did this version in a copule of hours to test Fabrizio Di Vittorio VGADirectController. It has been funny.

## About the game

This game has been realized without frame buffer. It only keeps the current drawing line.

I did some tests with bouncing color lines and scrolling bricks, but not al life is a commodore amiga demo so I keep it calm.

I know there are bugs, so you can anjoy fixing them.

## Game controls

- Mouse - Easiest to win
- Cursor keys

Play with friends or family is always more funny. Create your competitions.

## Game score

Just break all bricks, and it will start again. When you get bored stop.

You have 4 paddles to do this. 

## Hall of fame

There's no hall of fame, so you can record the screen with the mobile, betamax video cam, or 8mm or nobody will remember your name.
